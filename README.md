# game

For top level overview: ???

This repo contains the underlying game logic, which can be broken down
to the following sections:

1. Generate a board;
2. Choose an action that is compatible with the board;
3. Choose a metric & win condition compatible with these; 
4. Bundle these together and provide an API for recieving and validating
   moves.
